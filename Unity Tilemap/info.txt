example tiles by: www.kenney.nl (SUPPORT HIM!)

The layout of the example tiles only works with 8-bit but you can use them for 4-bit you just need to
figure out what goes into what array index for 4-bit as 4-bit is calculated differently from 8-bit.

To use 8-bit with your own tiles, arrange your tiles like in the example. That is the order they are checked with the bitmask and array index.


Go ahead and use and modify this script if you want.
